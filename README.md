# Campus_DiscussionForum

The objective of this online forum is to build an interactive platform for the students of CCOEW, Pune.

Students can ask questions and actively participate in discussions on
Institute-specific as well as technical/global topics.
It can also be used to know more about the clubs, cultural/technical fests, placement preparation and so much more.
